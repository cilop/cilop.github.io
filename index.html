<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome.</h4>

<p>This is my little landing page. Here, you can read up a little bit about me. I also have a personal blog setup <a href="http://cilo.me">here</a>. I'm an avid Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/cilotweet">scanner</a> (although I don't tweet myself that much), but I'll gladly reply to conversations. My most up to date professional information can be found at <a href="www.linkedin.com/pub/roberto-alvarez/4b/b67/50/">my LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>I'm currently going through the second part of <a href="http://hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor's</a> Software Engineering immersive program, working on student driven projects using Javascript, Node and related technologies. You can always find my latest work here, on my Github profile. It should be also available on their respective pages (hosted on Microsoft Azure).</p>

<p>From the last months at Hack Reactor, I have acquired new technical and communications skills. I am now comfortable working at any point of the full stack, and also with many current cutting edge technologies. My background is in Physics, so I've also worked on numerical analysis and optimization with algorithms like Montecarlo using Matlab. Other techniques such as Neural Networks also fascinate me; for this I have used open source libraries like <a href="http://pybrain.org/">PyBrain</a> for Python, or <a href="https://github.com/harthur/brain">BrainJS</a> for Javascript</p>

<p>Angular.js has an amazing way of empowering your HTML. You can very easily incorporate complex functionality with very little code. It has all sorts of ways for bringing websites to life, by allowing developers to easily setup model-view data binding, and also to do many other complex things by writing custom directives.</p>

<p>Firebase is certainly on top 3. I really like how easy it is to use, compared to other services out there. It also is very powerful when it comes to handling real time apps, and also plays nice with AngularJS. They also have a really simple API for authentication.</p>

<p>D3.js is also among my favorites. It is incredibly powerful, you can do all sorts of amazing visualizations with it, running 100% on front-end Javascript.</p>

</h2>

<p>It is a music editing app, running entirely on Javascript, using AngularJS. It is compatible with Lilypond code (in case you have never heard of it, it is just a markup language that compiles into PDF music sheets), so you can write music (instead of code), but still be able to share beautiful music sheets.</p>
